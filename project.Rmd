This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Load all of the packages that you end up using in your analysis in this code
# chunk.
library(ggplot2)
library('gridExtra')
library('dplyr')
library(alr3)
library(reshape2)
library(GGally)
library(scales)
library(memisc)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
# Load the Data
wine_data <- read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')
```

```{r}
dim(wine_data)
str(wine_data)
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
