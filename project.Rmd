 Red Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis
========================================================

  The dataset is available on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityReds.csv&sa=D&ust=1498100528570000&usg=AFQjCNE9-Ke0SkkDr3IOsMsSI8FcAdvWUQ">Red Wine Quality</a>.<br>
First, we get a first look at the data about sample size, fields in the dataset.

```{r}
# Load all of the packages that you end up using in your analysis in this code
# chunk.
library(ggplot2)
library('gridExtra')
library('dplyr')
library(alr3)
library(reshape2)
library(GGally)
library(scales)
library(memisc)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
# Load the Data
wine_data <- read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')
```

```{r}
dim(wine_data)
str(wine_data)
```

>The wines in the data have 13 attributes (components)
Explanation for some component can be found <a href="http://www.wineskills.co.uk/winemaking/winemaking-knowledge-base/chemical-composition">here</a>.<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}

# use head() just to get a quick overview of data
#head(wine_data)
names(wine_data)

```


><b>x</b>: the number of each wine in the sample
<br><br>
<b>fixed.acidity</b>: tartaric acid - g / dm^3<br>
most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
<br><br>
<b>volatile acidity</b>: acetic acid - g / dm^3<br>
the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
<br><br>
<b>citric acid</b>: g / dm^3<br>
found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
<br><br>
<b>residual sugar</b>: g / dm^3<br>
the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
<br><br>
<b>chlorides</b>: sodium chloride - g / dm^3<br>
the amount of salt in the wine
<br><br>
<b>free sulfur dioxide</b>: mg / dm^3<br>
the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
<br><br>
<b>total sulfur dioxide</b>: mg / dm^3<br>
amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
<br><br>
<b>density</b>: g / cm^3<br>
the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
<br><br>
<b>pH</b>:<br>
describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
<br><br>
<b>sulphates</b>: potassium sulphate - g / dm3<br>
a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
<br><br>
<b>alcohol</b>: % by volume<br>
the percent alcohol content of the wine
<br><br>
<b>quality</b>: score between 0 and 10<br>
Output variable, based on sensory data
<br><br>
